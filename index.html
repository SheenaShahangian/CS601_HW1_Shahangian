            <p>
                I believe in living a life that is well documented. As a professional photographer, 
                everything I do is about capturing moments. For my everyday work, this means documenting
                adventurous weddings in the great outdoors for my clients. However, it goes beyond that. 
                A life well documented also means making sure I'm capturing the small moments, whether 
                that's an image of the alpine lake I hiked to over the weekend or the window of the coffee 
                shop I frequent in the mornings. It also means writing about those experiences too.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want this little space on the web do to exactly that: show you the intersections of my life 
                and the complexities of both creating art for myself and for those around me. Being a 
                professional photographer, it's easy to make documentation all about the client, but it doesn't 
                have to be that way (nor should it!). This portfolio shows you the multi-faceted aspects of 
                who I am both professionally and personally. Who is Sheena? Let's go on a journey to find out.

                    I like to joke that there's pretty much nothing normal about me. I'm both creative and 
                    analytical. I'm introverted, yet also love getting to know people. I'm an avid hiker and 
                    explorer, but I also consider myself a homebody. Curious to know more about me?

                    I'm a big believer that part of living a well-rounded life means living a life of exploration. 
                    When I have free time, I try as hard as I can to not be at home; to get out and experience 
                    new trails, new mountains, new beaches, and new cultures. These are some of the places 
                    that have defined me.
