            <h2>My Unexpected Path</h2>
            <p>
                My path in life has been <em>anything</em> but predictable. I graduated with an undergraduate  
                degree in business and marketing with the assumption I wanted to work at a huge advertising agency. 
                After living the ad agency life for a bit, I quickly realized it was not my type of place <em>or</em> 
                lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always been a creative soul, so in my free time in the evenings, I began looking into what it 
                would look like to work as a photographer. After several photo courses and lots of online learning and 
                research, I launched my photo business. Things took off from there, and I quickly realized that 
                I had found my match.

            <h2>Where I Find My Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                When <em>most people</em> think about weddings, they think of huge productions. They easily forget 
                about the <em>true</em> meaning behind these days; the fact that they're about connection and being 
                inspired by another human being so much you want to commit your life to them. Elopements allow couples 
                to get back to that meaning and intention: the <em>true</em> reason people get married in the first 
                place. Elopements are extremely small ceremonies, oftentimes with only the couple themselves present. 
                They don't incorporate all of the fuss that comes with large, traditional weddings, and it's this 
                stripped down and minimalist approach to getting married that brings me alive and fires me up.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's videos like the one below that inspire me to do the job that I do, and for me to approach 
                my existence with intention, whether that's when I'm documenting someone's elopement day or 
                whether I'm simply hiking in the mountains.
