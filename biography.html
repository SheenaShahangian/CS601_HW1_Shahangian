            <h1>My Unexpected Path</h1>
            <p>
                My path in life has been anything but predictable. I graduated with an undergraduate degree in 
                business and marketing with the assumption I wanted to work at a huge advertising agency. 
                After living the ad agency life for a bit, I quickly realized it was not my type of place or 
                lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always been a creative soul, so in my free time in the evenings, I began looking into what it 
                would look like to work as a photographer. After several courses and lots of online learning and 
                research, I launched my photo business. Things took off from there, and I quickly realized that 
                I had found my match.
