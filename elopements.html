            <h1>All About My Day Job - Documenting Elopements</h1>
            <p>
                By night, I'm a student, but by day, I'm what's called an adventure elopement photographer. 
                So what exactly is that? Essentially, I photograph couples who have chosen to get married in 
                adventurous locations with no guests present (or a small number of guests). It's what we in 
                the wedding industry lovingly refer to as adventure elopements.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a number of things that go into my job, as it's a bit different than what your 
                traditional wedding photographer might do. Here's a sample of the services I offer to my 
                clients:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I help all my couples find an epic and adventurous spot to say their vows</li>
                    <li>I craft complete timelines for their elopement day, from start to finish</li>
                    <li>I provide vendor recommendations, including everything from flowers to dresses</li>
                    <li>I provide my couples with over 100 pages worth of planning guides and resources</li>
                    <li>And that's just the icing on the cake (pun intended!)</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Curious What an Elopement Day Looks Like?</h2>
            <p>
                Adventurous elopements are a strange concept to most people, but they're some of the most 
                incredible types of weddings, if you ask me! A picture is worth a thousand words, so here 
                are some photos of some of my couples, so you can get a feel for what it is that I do.
