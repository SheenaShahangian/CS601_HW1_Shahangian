# Read Me - MET CS 601 Sheena Shahangian

This iteration of my website contains the HTML for 4 pages. The homepage is the filename "index.html". I have placed all photos and videos within the "multimedia" directory. Please see below for a description of where I have included the requested elements (and where I have provided extras).

## Requested Elements

### Images

You can find multiple images on all pages, and I have also added an image for a site logo.

### Paragraphs

I have included at least 2 paragraphs of text on the home page, as well as paragraphs of text on all other pages of the website.

### External Hyperlinks

The footer contains an external hyperlink to my business's website (this is an external website). The biography page contains 8 external hyperlinks, excluding the one in the footer. These all go to home pages of websites that have published my work.

The shop page also contains 8 external hyperlinks, excluding the one in the footer. These links (I have actually made the entire article element linked) go to my gallery system, which is hosted elsewhere.

### Table

I have included a table of where my work has been published on the biography page. This includes the name of the publication (which is hyperlinked), the year my work was published by them, and where in the world that publication is located.

### List

### Navigation

I have used the same navigation on all pages. Per the professor's request, I have not made the navigation a list. I currently have a link to the home page (index.html) in the navigation, however the home page can also be accessed by clicking on the logo image.

### Incorporation of Other Additional Elements Presented During Class

I've attempted to add some new features beyond the standard requirements listed in the rubric. These include: 
* hyperlinked images
* using the section tag to create sections within a page that makes for more organized code.
* using the header, main, footer, strong, and em tags to increase my website's accessibility for those who use screen readers and to ensure I was prioritizing sematic elements as much as possible.
* using the article tag to represent self-contained elements within my shop page, specifically for each print that can be purchased.
* making the entire article for a shop item hyperlinked.
* incorporating buttons throughout to make navigation through the website's content more clear.
* use of additional imagery than the required amount to make each page visually appealing.
* creating custom imagery in the form of a logo (on all pages) and a timeline image (on the biography page).
* adding meta descriptions to all pages for SEO purposes.
* adding an email link in the footer so visitors can easily contact me.
* using classes and ids to help myself when styling my pages next week.
* using HTML entities for the copyright and dollar sign symbols.
* including both an embedded YouTube video and one using the video tag.
* resizing images and running them through an image optimizer before adding them to the multimedia folder, so as to ensure I'm not including files that are unnecessarily large. Images that are going to be hero images or larger have been included in larger sizer, however, to avoid quality degradation.
