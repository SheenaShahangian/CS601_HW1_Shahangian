# Read Me - MET CS 601 Sheena Shahangian

This iteration of my website contains the HTML for 4 pages. The homepage is the filename "index.html". I have placed all photos within the "multimedia" directory. Please see below for a description of where I have included the requested elements (and where I have provided extras).

## Requested Elements

### Images

You can find multiple images on all pages, and I have also added an image for a site logo.

### Paragraphs

I have included at least 2 paragraphs of text on all pages of my website.

### External Hyperlinks

The footer contains an external hyperlink to my business's website (this is an external website). The biography page contains 9 external hyperlinks, excluding the one in the footer. These all go to home pages of websites that have published my work.

The shop page also contains 8 external hyperlinks, excluding the one in the footer. These links (I have actually made the entire article element linked) go to my gallery system, which is hosted elsewhere.

### Tables

I have included a table of where my work has been published on the biography page. This includes the name of the publications (which are hyperlinked), the year my work was published by them, and where in the world the publications 
are located.

I have also included a table on the elopements page at the bottom, where I create a sample wedding day timeline for an adventurous elopement.

### List

I have included a list on the elopements.html page, where I list off common things I do for my photography clients who work with me for their wedding day.

### Navigation

I have used the same navigation on all pages. Per the professor's request, I have not made the navigation a list. I currently have a link to the home page (index.html) in the navigation, however that link is actually the logo in the bottom left-hand corner of the webpage.

### Video

I have included two embedded YouTube videos at the bottom of the biography page, each within a figure, so that a figcaption could be tied to the video.

### Incorporation of Other Additional Elements Presented During Class - How I Went Above and Beyond

I've attempted to add some new features beyond the standard requirements listed in the rubric. These include: 
* adding more than one video, more than one table, 4 pages to my site (instead of 3), including 18 external hyperlinks, including lots of extra paragraphs, and adding extra images on all pages.
* hyperlinked images
* using the section tag to create sections within a page that makes for more organized code.
* using the header, main, footer, strong, and em tags to increase my website's accessibility for those who use screen readers and to ensure I was prioritizing sematic elements as much as possible.
* use of figure and figcaption on my embedded videos, so I could provide credit to the videographers.
* using the article tag to represent self-contained elements within my shop page, specifically for each print that can be purchased.
* use of blockquotes on all pages (except the home page) to enhance the feeling and essence of what each page is about.
* use of an aside element (on the home page) that spotlights the essence of what the paragraphs surrounding it are about, much like 
a pullquote would do in a magazine.
* making the entire article for a shop item hyperlinked.
* incorporating buttons throughout to make navigating through the website's content more clear.
* use of additional imagery than the required amount to make each page visually appealing.
* creating custom imagery in the form of a logo (on all pages) and a timeline image (on the biography page).
* adding meta descriptions to all pages for SEO purposes.
* adding an email link in the footer so visitors can easily contact me.
* using classes and ids to help myself when styling my pages next week.
* using HTML entities for the copyright (in the footer) and dollar sign (on the shop page) symbols.
* resizing images and running them through an image optimizer before adding them to the multimedia folder, so as to ensure I'm not including files that are unnecessarily large. Images that are going to be hero images or larger have been included in larger sizer, however, to avoid quality degradation. Image dimensions will vary, as some images are intentionally cropped square for my future design and aren't intended to spread across the width of the page (for example, the first image on the biography page). Smaller images are also used for the products linked in the shop, as they are going to be smaller images in the final product, and I'm trying to keep the website lightweight.
