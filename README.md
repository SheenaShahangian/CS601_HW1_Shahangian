## Requested Elements

### Images

You can find multiple images on all pages, and I have also added an image for a site logo.

### Paragraphs

### External Hyperlinks

The footer contains an external hyperlink to my business's website. The biography page contains 8 external hyperlinks, excluding the one of the footer. These all go to home pages of websites that have published my work.

### Table

I have included a table of where my work has been published on the biography page. This includes the name of the publication (which is hyperlinked), the year my work was published by them, and where in the world that publication is located.

### List

### Navigation

I have used the same navigation on all pages. Per the professor's request, I have not made the navigation a list. I currently have a link to the home page (index.html), however this home page can also be accessed by clicking on the logo image.
